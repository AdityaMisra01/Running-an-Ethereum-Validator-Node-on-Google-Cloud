# Running an Ethereum Validator Node on Google Cloud

## Introduction

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on how to set up and run an Ethereum validator node using Google Cloud's infrastructure. This guide will walk through setting up an Ethereum validator node step by step, ensuring you have a complete understanding of the process. By the end of this guide, you'll have a fully operational Ethereum validator node running securely on Google Cloud.

## Validator Nodes Overview

Validator nodes play a pivotal role in the Ethereum network's security and consensus mechanism. As validators, you'll participate in transaction validation, block proposal, and network consensus. You'll be rewarded with ETH for your contributions. However, it's essential to execute your duties properly to avoid penalties, including staked ETH slashing.

### Responsibilities and Rewards

Your validator node responsibilities include:
- Validating transactions and proposing new blocks
- Maintaining high uptime and reliability
- Participating in consensus activities

For your efforts, you'll earn ETH rewards. To participate, you'll need to stake 32 ETH as collateral.

## Requirements

Setting up an Ethereum validator node on Google Cloud requires specific hardware and software configurations:

**Hardware Requirements**
- Virtual Machine: 4 vCPUs, 16 GB RAM, 200 GB SSD storage
- Network: Sufficient bandwidth for optimal performance

**Software Requirements**
- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Ethereum 2.0 Execution Client: Go Ethereum (Geth)
- Ethereum 2.0 Consensus Client: Lighthouse

Choosing Geth as the execution client and Lighthouse as the consensus client offers performance and direct Eth2 chain compatibility.

## Installation & Configuration 

1. **Create GCP VM Instance**: Set up a VM instance on Google Cloud Platform with the specified hardware requirements. Remember to save the IP address.

2. **SSH into VM**: Access your VM using SSH.

3. **Update Ubuntu**: Keep your system updated by running the following commands:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: Install necessary dependencies:
   ```
   sudo apt install make gcc git libpq-dev -y
   ```

5. **Install Geth**: Clone the Geth repository and build:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
   cd go-ethereum
   make geth
   ```

6. **Install Lighthouse**: Clone the Lighthouse repository and build:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse
   cd lighthouse
   cargo build --release
   ```

7. **Create Data Directories**: Set up directories for data storage:
   ```
   mkdir /var/lib/lighthouse
   mkdir /var/lib/geth
   ```

8. **Generate Validator Keys**: Create validator keys with a password:
   ```
   lighthouse account validator generate --directory /var/lib/lighthouse --password /path/to/password/file
   ```

9. **Configure and Enable Services**: Edit service files to point to data directories. Enable Geth and Lighthouse services to start on boot:
   ```
   systemctl enable geth
   systemctl enable lighthouse
   ```

## Staking ETH

Stake 32 ETH to activate your validator:

1. **Generate Wallet**: Create an Ethereum wallet address to receive Goerli ETH.

2. **Acquire Goerli ETH**: Get Goerli ETH from faucets like https://goerlifaucet.com/.

3. **Transfer ETH**: Transfer at least 32 Goerli ETH to your wallet.

4. **Generate Validator Deposit**: Use the deposit CLI to generate a validator deposit:
   ```
   /usr/local/bin/deposit new-validator --eth1-withdrawal-address=ETH_WITHDRAWAL_ADDRESS --chain=goerli
   ```

5. **Send Deposit**: Send the deposit to the Eth2 deposit contract to activate your validator. Ensure to follow security best practices.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Ensure smooth operation with these monitoring and maintenance tips:

- Use Prometheus and Grafana for real-time metrics.
- Configure alerts for critical events.
- Monitor your validator status on beaconcha.in.
- Keep software updated, including security patches.
- Regularly back up data and configuration files.
- Troubleshoot using logs and status endpoints.

## Security Best Practices

Protect your validator node with these security practices:

- Use a cloud firewall to limit exposed ports.
- Avoid root login and use SSH keys.
- Safeguard validator and withdrawal keys.
- Utilize hardware wallets or offline signing.
- Store keys and phrases securely offline.
- Operate on dedicated, secure hardware.
